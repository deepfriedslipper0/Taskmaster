        NICO: Hello, I'm Meg Davies, the Taskmaster, and welcome to a new episode of Taskmaster! I've locked Greg Davies
        in my basement and taken his place. But enough of that. Who are our contestants? Please
        welcome: Alex Amelines, Charlie Amelines, L'ran Beech, MaryAnne Beech and John Beech!
        The stakes are high and the competition is fierce as these brave contestants battle it out for the ultimate
        Taskmaster title. Who will come out on top and earn the right to brag to their friends and family about their
        victory? Stay tuned to find out! And now, next to me, a man who will still not tell me the secret of how to
        whistle. *tries to whistle* *pause* It's little Rafael!<br><br>RAFI: *whistles* Thank you, Meg. Do you want to
        play a little game?<br><br>NICO: I love little games.<br><br>RAFI: Well then, you'll love this little game.
        *pause* Riddle me this: I'm light as a feather, but even the world's strongest man couldn't hold me for much
        longer than a minute. What am I?<br><br>NICO: I don't know, Alex. What are you?<br><br>RAFI: A
        human.<br><br>NICO: Pardon?<br><br>RAFI: Yes, can't you tell?<br><br>*insert laughing here*<br><br>NICO: Anyway,
        let's get on with the first task of the show!

        <strong>Task 1</strong><br>
        NICO: What's the first task, Alex?<br><br>RAFI: For the first task of the show, everyone must pick an object in
        this room and hold it if possible. If not, just stand next to it. I would now like MaryAnne Beech to read the
        task out.<br><br>MARYANNE: Create the highest pitched sound with your object; hitting tools have been provided
        if necessary. Highest pitched sound wins. Also, you may trade objects, provided neither of you have hit your
        objects yet and you both agree to do it. You have 1 minute. Your time started when you opened the
        task.<br><br>RAFI: Ok, one minute is up, we will now hear your sounds. Mug, bookend, hook, penpot, music stand,
        piano (if used). The winner is [insert winner]. Congratulations!<br><br>NICO: [comments] Ok, Alex, let's have a
        look at the scoreboard.<br><br>RAFI: Rightio.<br><br>NICO: Ok, what's the second task, Alex?

        RAFI: The second task involves rubber, ducks and rubber ducks! I would like Charlie Amelines to read the task
        out.<br><br>CHARLIE: There are 30 images of yellow rubber ducks hidden in this room. Find the most in order to
        win. You must have all your ducks on your person at all times; if you drop one, it does not count towards your
        duck total.There are also 2 bonus points up for grabs for whoever finds the mysterious pink duck. You have 10
        minutes. Your time starts now.<br><br>RAFI: 10 minutes is up. Let's have a look at your scores!<br><br>NICO:
        While Alex is counting up your ducks, I just want to say [comments].<br><br>RAFI: The winner is [winner]! Let us
        move swiftly on to the third task!

        <strong>Task 3</strong><br>
        RAFI: Task Number 3 unleashes the artiness within all of our contestants. This is the first group task, so I
        have assigned you all to either a group of 2 or a group of 3. We'll have Charlie and L'ran together, and Alex,
        MaryAnne and John together. Right, let us begin. L'ran is going to read the task out for us.<br><br>L'RAN:
        Create the most flattering portrait of the Taskmaster with the art supplies provided. One of your teammates must
        be blindfolded throughout, and this teammate is the only one who may touch or use the art supplies or paper. The
        other teammates must guide the blindfolded one but must not come into contact with them. You have 15 minutes.
        Your time starts when the Taskmaster says the name of a vegetable.<br><br>RAFI: 15 minutes is up!<br><br>NICO:

        along with your names. I will give you 2 minutes to do so.<br><br>2 minutes is up. So, earlier, I asked an AI to
